    "The easiest way to load image data is with `datasets.ImageFolder` from `torchvision` (https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.html). In general you'll use `ImageFolder` like so:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data', transform=transform)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a sequence of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.9/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n",

    "root/dog/xxx.png\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load in the data with `ImageFolder`, you'll need to define some transforms. For example, the images are different sizes but we'll need them to all be the same size for training. You can either resize them with `transforms.Resize()` or crop with `transforms.CenterCrop()`, `transforms.RandomResizedCrop()`, etc. We'll also need to convert the images to PyTorch tensors with `transforms.ToTensor()`. Typically you'll combine these transforms into a pipeline with `transforms.Compose()`, which accepts a list of transforms and runs them in sequence. It looks something like this to scale, then crop, then convert to a tensor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255),\n",
    "                                transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Loaders\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `ImageFolder` loaded, you have to pass it to a [`DataLoader`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). The `DataLoader` takes a dataset (such as you would get from `ImageFolder`) and returns batches of images and the corresponding labels. You can set various parameters like the batch size and if the data is shuffled after each epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `dataloader` is a [generator](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/04/07/improve-your-python-yield-and-generators-explained/). To get data out of it, you need to loop through it or convert it to an iterator and call `next()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Looping through it, get a batch on each loop \n",
    "for images, labels in dataloader:\n",

    "A common strategy for training neural networks is to introduce randomness in the input data itself. For example, you can randomly rotate, mirror, scale, and/or crop your images during training. This will help your network generalize as it's seeing the same images but in different locations, with different sizes, in different orientations, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "Subtracting `mean` centers the data around zero and dividing by `std` squishes the values to be between -1 and 1. Normalizing helps keep the network weights near zero which in turn makes backpropagation more stable. Without normalization, networks will tend to fail to learn.\n",

    "You can find a list of all [the available transforms here](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/transforms.html). When you're testing however, you'll want to use images that aren't altered other than normalizing. So, for validation/test images, you'll typically just resize and crop.\n",
